# Rubik's Cube Solver
This is a Rubik's Cube solver that uses Thistlewaite's algorithm and openCV to solve the cube.

# How It Works
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automataton simulation on a 2D grid, where each cell has two possible states: dead or alive. Each cell has neighbours in every direction including diagonally (eight neighbours total). The simulation follows these rules:
1) A live cell with less than two neighbours dies (isolation).
2) A live cell with two or three neighbours survives (survival)
3) A cell with more than three neighbours dies (overpopulation).
4) A dead cell with exactly three neighbours becomes alive (reproduction).
