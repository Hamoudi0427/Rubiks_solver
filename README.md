# Rubik's Cube Solver
This is a Rubik's Cube solver that uses Thistlewaite's algorithm to solve the cube and openCV to get input from a webcam.

# Thistlewaite's Algorithm
Thistlewaite's algorithm is an algorithm designed by Morwen B. Thistelwaite that allows a Rubik's Cube to be programatically solved in under 45 moves (with the average number of moves being around 30. The algorithm works by moving the cube from one group to another, with each group having less available moves, restricting the cube to fewer and fewer possibilities till it is solved.
